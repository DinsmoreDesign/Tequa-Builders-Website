                    we expected, and we couldn’t be happier with our new playroom.</i>

                    amount of money and they even did more work that I asked them to do, for no added cost. I will use them again and will let
                    everyone I know to call them for any construction projects they have. Thanks guys!</i>

                    Tequa did a major remodel throughout my home, with very little disruption to my wife and I. The work was substantial and there
                    were no hidden costs when the job was completed. They did it in a shorter amount of time than they anticipated, and within the
                    original budget. They will get referrals from us. Great job, thank you.</i>
